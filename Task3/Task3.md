# PostgreSQL Data Pipeline for Search Insights

This project involves a data pipeline that connects to a PostgreSQL database, executes a series of queries to retrieve search click data, and inserts the results into a summary table. The pipeline runs daily, performing the following tasks:

1. **Calculates the average click-through rate (CTR).**
2. **Fetches the top queries based on CTR within a given date range.**
3. **Identifies low-performance queries (those with high impressions but low clicks).**
4. **Inserts the results into a summary table for further analysis.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `psycopg2` - PostgreSQL database adapter for Python
- `json` - JSON handling (comes with Python)
- `schedule` - For scheduling the pipeline to run periodically
- PostgreSQL running locally or remotely


#  Script Overview
## Key Functions
run_pipeline()

This function connects to the PostgreSQL database, executes several queries, and inserts the results into a summary table. The pipeline performs the following steps:

Average CTR Query: Retrieves the average click-through rate for the search_clicks table.
Top Queries Query: Fetches the top 5 search queries based on click-through rate between a specified date range.
Low Performance Queries Query: Finds search queries with more than 100 impressions but fewer than 10 clicks.
Insert Results: Inserts the results into a search_insights table.


# Scheduling the Pipeline

 ## The script uses the schedule module to run the run_pipeline() function daily at midnight:


schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(run_pipeline)


# Conclusion
## This pipeline automates the process of calculating and storing search click insights in a PostgreSQL database. It fetches useful metrics such as the average click-through rate, top queries, and low-performing queries, helping businesses gain insights into their search data.
